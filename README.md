# Auto Play/Pause

This is a program that automatically plays and pauses an online video player based on whether or not your eye(s) is detected. I wrote this primarily to auto play and pause YouTube videos while I eat. I'm a messy eater and therefore my hands get messy and I don't wanna touch my computer.

# Installation Instructions
1. Clone repo
2. Install opencv
3. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start youtube video and run program
